# Experiment 12
# AIM
To implement and study constructors and destructors
# THEORY
In C++, constructors and destructors are essential ideas for controlling an object's lifecycle. To aid with your understanding and application, below is a brief synopsis and example. <br>

The purpose of constructors is that they are unique member functions that are called automatically upon the creation of an object within a class. They serve as the object's initialization. <BR>
Categories: <BR>
* By Default Constructor: Does not accept input.
* Set parameters Constructor: Accepts parameters to set the object's initial values.
* Copy Paste Constructor: A new object is created by copying an existing object using the copy constructor. <br>

The purpose of destructors is to be special member functions that are run automatically when an object is removed intentionally or goes out of scope. They are employed to carry out tidying up duties, like resource releases.<br>
Features:
* The destructor bears the class name, with a tilde (`~`) before it.
* It does not return any value and does not accept any arguments.
